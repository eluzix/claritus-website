Built on a powerful financial-data platform and designed with a friendly, intuitive interface, Claritus not only gives you a full view of your money and investments but provides accurate insights and assessments. Although Claritus is currently in its Beta version, we plan on expanding the service to include many more tools that will allow you to actively manage and control your wealth – all from one easy-to-use place.

We would love to hear what you think of Claritus. What you like, what you expected to see in this version, what your needs are, and what you’d like to see in future versions. Your feedback is invaluable to Claritus’s growth, and we urge you to get in touch with us and let us know.

With over 20 years (each) of tech-startup experience, we have a passion for finding solutions and bringing our visions to reality. Claritus was born out of a genuine need we all had in tracking our finances. We have put all of that passion and know-how into Claritus. It’s the tool we use, and we hope you will find it just as useful as we do.
