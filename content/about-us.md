##Our story

ourStoryTitle: Our Story

ourStory: 'Claritus was born out of a very real and personal need. Our previous careers had enabled us to achieve financial freedom. All of us learned that managing wealth is extremely challenging, there is so much to consider, and it all takes a lot of time and expertise. <br/><br/> While searching for a reliable, comprehensive, and unbiased solution that would allow us to easily view, analyze, and nurture our wealth, we soon realized that none of the options available have the necessary what it takes. <br/><br/> That got us wondering: How many more people were out there facing the same challenges we were facing? Together, we decided then that it was up to us to come up with a viable solution to simply keep track of wealth. <br/><br/> <strong>That was the birth of Claritus.</strong>'
