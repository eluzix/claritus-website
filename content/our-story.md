A few years ago, I was fortunate enough to achieve financial freedom through hard work, determination and persistence. I suddenly found myself looking ahead at an open horizon that allowed me to pick and choose how I would like to continue my life’s journey. I knew that my top priorities were spending more time with my loved ones and managing our finances and investments in an intelligent and responsible manner.

But managing one’s assets, I quickly learned, is hard work. There’s so much to consider, be constantly on top of, and it all requires a great deal of time and know-how. Here I was, suddenly having to learn new skills in order to take charge of my wealth and feeling like I might require a formal degree in finance.

I spent a lot of time online, searching for a reliable, comprehensive tool that would allow me to clearly and easily view, manage, and control my assets, but soon understood that one of what was  available really worked for me.

That got me wondering: How many more people were out there facing the same challenges I was facing? I reached out to my two partners - who were in the same boat as I - and we decided then and there that it was up to us to come up with a viable solution.
