We consider our referral program to be our appreciation program to give back to our loyal customers like you for being our ambassadors.

Here at Claritus we like to keep it simple. All you have to do is be a customer of Claritus and recommend Claritus to your friends and colleagues.

Once your friend has signed up, let us know at [hello@claritus.io](mailto:hello@claritus.io), and both of you will get $50 worth of credits* towards your subscription.

This is our way of saying thank you for being a loyal customer!
