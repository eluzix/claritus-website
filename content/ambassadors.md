**Our referral program is our way of saying thanks to loyal customers like you for being our ambassadors.**

At Claritus, we like to keep things simple. All you have to do is be a customer of Claritus and recommend Claritus to your colleagues and friends.

**Once your friend has signed up, please notify us at [hello@claritus.io](mailto:hello@claritus.io), and you'll each receive a $50 credit\* toward your Claritus subscription.**

This is our way of saying thanks for being a loyal customer and Claritus ambassador!
