I’m very excited to share that Claritus has moved from Beta to its early commercial phase following your support. Our user interface has been completely revamped to make Claritus even more convenient and simple for you.

Over the past year, we have listened to our beta customers’ suggestions, feedback, and comments. We even incorporated some of these needs into the platform and planning to continue adding many more to strengthen Claritus’ offering.

As gratitude for being part of our Beta customers, we want to award you a FREE subscription to Claritus for an entire year. All it takes is to sign in to your Claritus account and click on the claim button to receive your free subscription.
Please make sure you claim your FREE one-year subscription within 14 days. After which, this option will no longer be available.

Feel free to contact me directly or our customer support if you have any questions, comments, or concerns. The team and I are always here to help.

I want to take this opportunity and thank you again for the trust and support you gave us from the very beginning and during the entire Beta phase. 
We are truly grateful for that.

Sincerely,  
Shai Azran,  
Claritus co-founder & CEO
