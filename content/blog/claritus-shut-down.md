Claritus was born out of a genuine and personal need. Our goal was to offer investors a tool that helped them rather than forced them to work hard to have a clear view of their personal portfolio.

The last two years were a fantastic ride. Claritus grew and attracted many passive investors with different needs. And as simple as the product was, your reactions to it were amazing. The trust you gave us with your most sensitive information was very humbling, and we did our best to deserve this trust. Unfortunately, we didn't manage to bring enough funding to keep Claritus alive and to grow the service as we imagined it. As such, we have made the decision to close Claritus service and its operations.


### What's next?
Claritus will cease to exist on October 30, 2022. Within 30 days of the shutdown, all information, including any discussions and help tickets, will be purged.
In the following weeks, all paying subscribers will receive a refund for their last payment. We will cancel any future payments.

### Is there anything you need to do?
You can export all your personal financial information from your account settings page if you want to keep a copy. No action is needed if you do not want a copy of the data.


Feel free to contact us before the shutdown with any questions, feedback, or concerns.


We want to thank you all for believing in us and being part of our journey to bring clarity to investors' personal finance.

Claritus founders.
