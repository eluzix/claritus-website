If you’re reading this post then you’re probably one of Claritus’ first users, what we call a beta user - or at least thinking of becoming one.

Firstly, we want to thank you for your interest in Claritus. Claritus was born out of a real, authentic and personal need and our overall mission is to bring financial peace of mind to many more people with our platform.

Claritus is currently in its beta phase, which means the service is almost ready, but not quite. We’re still changing and improving some things and adding new features, to make sure you have the best experience possible. We’re going to be launching our full and complete service in a few months and It will be available on a subscription basis.

However, as a thank you for being one of our first users, and baring with us through this period as well as providing us with feedback, and for sharing your needs and pains - we want to give you an annual subscription to Claritus - for free.

Best Regards, {{< rawhtml >}}<br/>{{< /rawhtml >}}
The Claritus Team
