Whether you’re new to Claritus and want to play around and orient yourself, or like to follow step-by-step instructions and take your time before committing to a service, Claritus gives you the option to enter your information manually, at your own pace.

It may seem like a whole lot of unnecessary work on your part, having to enter dates and figures when you can simply link your accounts to Claritus and view them automatically – but when dealing with private, sensitive data such as your financial information, we figure it’s best to let you choose. There is, however, a way that will eventually cut down your manual work and still enjoy all of Claritus’s insights, such as:

<ul>
    <li>A 360-degree view of all your assets and investments</li>
    <li>A historical view (dating back to a time period of your choice) of all returns for each asset or asset group, or for your full portfolio</li>
    <li>Sort and Filter your returns, whether by single asset, asset type/group, or overall</li>
</ul>

Here are our ‘Best Practices’ guidelines for getting the most out of Claritus:
We highly recommend you update your data on a regular basis (monthly, quarterly, annually – that’s completely up to you) for each investment or asset. This takes just a few seconds per holding, and gives you a better, more precise picture of your finances looking back. Keep in mind, it is always best to enter each holding’s valuation at its end-of-business-day closing value.

We know that most people don’t have an immaculately-organized, fully updated portfolio (but now you can, because that’s what Claritus is for). That’s why we’ve made it easy for you to add or remove data points anytime you want. You don’t have to do so in any chronological order and you can always change your timeframes. Want to switch from quarterly to monthly intervals? No problem, just enter the amounts and ‘effective dates’ and Claritus will build a clearer, more precise picture of your wealth.

Don’t stress if you’re missing data for a specific asset or investment. Take your time to discover all relevant data and enter it at your leisure. Every data point you add will shed more light on your holdings’ status and historical returns, allowing for clearer insights and better projections moving forward.

Once again, we’d like to take this opportunity to remind you that all of your data is safe, private and secure at all times; we do not have access to any of your accounts or personal information at any time – whatever you link or enter into Claritus is for your eyes only.
